## 🚀 Some of my Best Projects 
- 🔗 **House Price Prediction**
  
    What is this ?
    
   This is an end-to-end Machine Learning + Web Development project where a trained ML model is exposed via a backend API and consumed by a modern frontend application.
    Makeing this project is really fun and some frustation due to unfamiliarity of the fastapi , At the end it turned out really good . It's also responsive , I just
    Thought that a prediction project should run on mobile or any device so, I made it resposive too ! , The UI might not be my best work in this project but I will try
    to improve this later

   Tech: React, Tailwind , FastAPI , ML , Python , Pydantic

- 🔗 **Realme Clone**

  What is this ?
  
  A pixel-perfect replica of the official Realme landing page, built using React + Tailwind CSS.
  This project’s goal was to recreate the original Realme homepage as accurately as possible, focusing on layout, visuals, responsiveness, and UI precision.
  This is personally one of my favorite Projects , because it's one of my first projects that I actually really enjoyed developing a app
  althou, it's simple and not really challenging to build , it's is the project that raised my intrust in development and programming in general

  Tech: React, Tailwind  👉 [View RC Github](https://github.com/Sri-Harsha-ka/Realme-Clone)  👉 [View RC Demo](https://realme-clone-d3an.vercel.app/)

- 🔗 **PIB Project Idea Base**

  *What is this ?*
  
  A minimal MERN application built to store, organize, and preserve project ideas in one place.
  I often get random ideas for projects or features, but I forget them later — so I built PIB as a simple personal tool to keep everything structured.
  
  Tech: React, Tailwind, Express , MongoDB  👉 [View PIB Github](https://github.com/Sri-Harsha-ka/PIB-Project-Idea-Base)  👉 [View PIB Demo](http://pib-project-idea-base.vercel.app)
